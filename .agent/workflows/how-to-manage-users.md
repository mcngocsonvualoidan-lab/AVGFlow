# User Management Guide

This workflow guides you through the process of adding, editing, and managing user profiles.

## Prerequisites
- You must have **Admin Rights** to add or delete users, or to edit users other than yourself.
- You must be on the **User Management** page (`/users`).

## Steps

1.  **Enable Admin Mode**
    -   Look for the **Admin Mode** button (Shield icon) in the top control bar.
    -   Click it to toggle it **ON**.
    -   *Note*: If you are not an Admin, this action will be denied.

2.  **Add a New User**
    -   Ensure Admin Mode is **ON**.
    -   Click the **Thêm mới** (Add +) button in the top right corner.
    -   A modal panel will open with a blank form.

3.  **Edit an Existing User**
    -   Find the user card in the list (use the Search bar if needed).
    -   Hover over the user card.
    -   Click the **pencil icon** (Edit) overlaid on the card.
    -   The modal panel will open with the user's current data.

4.  **Modify User Information (Modal)**
    -   **Avatar**: Click the "Upload" button to choose an image file (max 2MB), or click the "refresh" icon for a random generated avatar.
    -   **Status**: Toggle **Admin Access** (grants admin rights) or **Đã xác minh** (Verified status).
    -   **Personal Info**: Update Name, Email, Phone.
    -   **Employment Info**: Select Department, Role, and Start Date.
    -   **Detailed Info**: Enter **Mã nhân viên** (Employee Code) and **Số Hợp Đồng** (Contract No) in the dedicated fields.
    -   **Banking**: Update Bank Name (e.g., MB, VCB) and Account Number.

5.  **Save Changes**
    -   Review the information.
    -   Click the **Lưu thay đổi** (Save Changes) button at the bottom right of the modal.
    -   A success notification should appear.

## Troubleshooting
-   **"Access Denied"**: You do not have permission to edit this user. Only Admins can edit others.
-   **"Name Required"**: You must enter a name.
-   **Changes not showing**: Try refreshing the page.
